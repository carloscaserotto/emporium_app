#Note that we use the new has_many :through syntax
#With the syntax, we can access books belonging to a cart directly by using
#@cart_object.books, even though the two classes donâ€™t have a direct relationship. Without
#using the new :through option, we would need to laboriously go through the CartItem class:
#@cart_object.cart_items.map {|ci| ci.book }.

#inject is a method for arrays and other enumerable objects that can be used to calculate
#sums, factorials, and so on of all the items in the container object. It takes one initial parameter
#(in our case, 0) and passes it as the first block parameter (in our case, sum) for the first iteration.
#Then it passes each item of cart_items to the block as n, one at a time, updating the sum all the
#time. After it has gone through all of the items, it returns the final value of sum.
